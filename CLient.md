Question: What is the cost of launching a quest?

Answer: Launching a quest is free. However, if you want additional equity, such as featuring your quest on TaskOn's recommendation page or social media channels , you may want to upgrade your membership.

Question: How can I schedule my quest?

Answer: When you are creating your quest, you can select your Quest Period (starting date & ending date). You can choose to start the quest immediately after the task is published.

Question: How can I set up an event? How can I organize an event together with other projects? How can I invite other projects to my event as a co-host?

Answer: Video available.

First, go to "Quest Hub" and click "Event". Click "Create Event" on the upper right corner. On the following page, you will see the maximum 3 steps to publish an event. Enter the "Event Name", let's say "I love TaskOn!!!" Choose the starting and ending date and then select your "Event Cover Image". Enter "Event Description". It's optional, but an informative and eye-catching one can attract more participants. Click "Next". On the next page, set up your "Event Rewards", in the exactly same way you would set up your "Quest Rewards." Choose your "Distribution Method", add "Token", select "Total Reward Amount" and "Number of Winners." Click "Confirm" and "Next". The next step is selecting the "Quests" that you want to include in this "Event." It's better to set up your "Quests" beforehand, but you can also set them up after starting to create the "Event". Please notice that an "Event" needs to include at least 2 "Quests", and a "Quest" can be included in only one "Event." Then, you can invite your cohosts, and they will also add their own quests and rewards to the "Event". But of course, you can also do it on your own. Enter the minimum number of "Quests" that must be completed. Here, we choose 2. The next step is "Send Event Invitation" and you will see that the "Event" is "Under Review."  All you need to do now is waiting for your co-hosts to respond! After every project has added its quests and rewards, as the host you can officially publish the "Event."

Question: How to set up a completion-based API task?

Answer: Video available.

Go to "Community Hub" and click "Task". On the right side, choose "Custom Template" and "Completion-Based API Task." First, provide a quick and informative description of what the task is about. Let's say "Register for our website and publish 3 posts." Click "Set API" and start configuring your API URl. First, choose between "Social Media Account" and "Wallet Address" as a means to identify users who have completed the task. Let's choose "X Handle". Then, enter your API URL for verification. Make sure that it meets the requirements in API Standards Specification. Then click "Next". On the following page, you can verify your configuration. In the first line, enter the handle of a qualified user; in the second line, enter the handle of a disqualified one. Click "Verify API URl". If the information you have provided is correct, your API URL is now correctly configured. Then, enter the website where you hope this action will take place. Set up rewards. Let's say 100 points. Click "Publish" and your first completion-based API task is all set up!

Question: When will the winner list be available, if we select the lucky draw as the distribution method?

Answer: The winner list will be automatically generated after the quest expires. But sometimes there might be a delay due to the queue[GC1] . This can also happen, if there are PoW tasks involved, which could take time to review. If the PoW tasks are not approved by the project in time, they are considered "Completed" by default.

Question: Will the rewards be automatically distributed to the winners?

Answer: After the projects have uploaded the winner lists and deposited their tokens beforehand, TaskOn will distribute the rewards automatically. The winners need not to take another action to claim their rewards[GC2] .

If you were placed on TaskOn's whitelist or the tokens that you choose to distribute as rewards were not supported by our networks, you would need to distribute the rewards manually after the completion of the quest. The distribution should take place within one week.

Question: Why hasn't my quest attracted enough participants?

Answer: A variety of reasons have an impact on the number of participants. For instance, if you have not yet verified your community, your quest will not appear on our recommendation page. Or, you might want to consider offering strong incentives that appeal to your target audiences. External promotion on social media can also be an effective tool[GC3] .

For beginners, we recommend that projects create easy quests that contain no more than 5 tasks.

Question:  How to change the expiration date of my quest?

Answer: Normally, we do not recommend that you change the expiration date, because it is likely to create distrust among the participants. However, if it must be changed, you may contact TaskOn for support.

Question: How can I add my quest to my event?

Answer: You need to have set up your quest before creating an event.

Question: How can I change the login method?

Answer: In order to change your login method, you need to go to our main page and log in as a user. Click "Launch App" and your profile image. Choose your profile and click the "x" sign next to the login method you want to replace. Unlink it first and then enter a new account.

Question:  Why must I deposit tokens first?

Answer: When you deposit tokens, the rewards will be distributed automatically once the quest expires. The winners will immediately receive their rewards, and projects will not need to make extra efforts.

In addition, the deposited token guarantees the rewards, which adds to the credibility of the quest, so that users are more likely to participate.

Question: If the rewards that I select are not tokens or points, when should I distribute them[GC4] ?

Answer: In this case, you should distribute the rewards within one week after the quest expires.

If not, the winners are likely to file complaints, and TaskOn might also impose penalties accordingly.

Question: What is the deadline for reviewing PoW tasks?

Answer: You need to review PoW tasks within 7 days after the quest expires.

Question: When I create a quest, I need to select networks both for rewards and for on-chain tasks. Do they need to be the same?

Answer: No, they do not[GC5] . But we highly recommend that you select a network with lower gas fees.

Question: If I have already deposited my tokens, but why can't I see them in Assets?

Answer: There are a few scenarios.

First,  the transaction has not been successfully completed. In this case, please re-send your submission.

Second, the transaction has been successfully completed, but the tokens are still not deposited in Assets. In this case,  the issue might have something to do with the contract, and you need to provide your wallet address to TaskOn. Our development team will follow up.

Question: What are the purposes of points? How can I edit my points?

The points that users receive from completing a task are directly linked to their member level. It is a great way for you to assess the contributions that users have made, so that you can reward them with tokens accordingly after TGE.

In addition, a comprehensive member-level system can motivate members to actively participate and make contributions. This is because higher-level members typically enjoy additional benefits, such as exclusive events, special badges, or other specific privileges.

In their efforts to advance their levels, members build a deeper sense of engagement and belonging, which means that the level system can increase member retention and loyalty.

TaskOn provides a highly flexible platform and you can personalize your membership structure to shape a more identity-driven community.

To set up your level system, first click Community Hub, then click Points & Level. Click Edit on the upper right corner to start your customization. Choose your Points Name. GameFi games frequently use "XP" or "EXP", while Linea community adopts "LXP". But you can pick whatever you like.

Move to the right side, and you can select a Points Logo and write a short description to introduce your points. Make it memorable and unique! Click Edit Level Settings, and you can decide how a user can level up. Linear means that every time users accumulate a certain number of points, say 50, they will automatically level up. You can also choose the maximum level. Let's say 20. Click confirm, and you will see the new level system.

Another option is customized. This way, you can decide the specific number of points each level requires. For instance, you can make things easier in the beginning, and harder and harder later on. Therefore, leveling up will become more challenging, and there is more prestige associated with a high level.

Click Confirm, and you have successfully set up your very own points-based level system.

Question: How can I integrate my Telegram with TaskOn bot?

Answer: When you add the TaskOn bot to your Telegram, your community members can easily access the latest information about your projects, thereby enhancing community engagement.

Go to "Community Hub", click "Bot Integration", and then choose "Telegram Integration." We now offer 3 features: "Automatic notification", "Predefined commands", and "Telegram Mini Program".

Answer: By adding the TaskOn bot to your Discord server, your community members can easily access the latest information about your projects, so that the community engagement will be greatly enhanced. Moreover, TaskOn also provides automatic features such as announcements, Discord Role distribution, and task verification.

Go to "Community Hub", click "Bot Integration", then "Discord Integration". At this point, TaskOn supports 5 features. "Automatic Notification" means that whenever you create a new task, quest, or event, it will be automatically posted in your Discord community, and your members can participate immediately.

With "Predefined Commands", the bot will help you complete simple tasks. For instance, when users type in "Ranking", it will automatically pull out the ranking information. "Discord Role Auto-Distribution" helps you distribute Discord Roles to specific users or winners.

When you set a "Chat on Discord" task, you may add "Discord Message" feature, which will help you monitor when users are actually chatting, thereby boosting their engagement. There will be more features like "Discord Alerts", "Ticketing", and "Giveaway" that will come soon!

Let's choose "Automatic Notification on Discord" as an example. Click, and enter your "Discord Server URL". Don't forget to make the URL permanent.

Copy and paste the link and click. Proceed to click "Add TaskOn bot to your server & grant permissions". Please note that different features will require different permissions, and in this case, you need to allow "Add a bot to a server", "Access your username, avatar, and banner", and "Create command".

Click "Continue" and in the next step, you are required to Stanley, Taskon's bot, the following permissions: "View channels", "Send messages", "Embed links", and "Mention everyone, here, and all roles."

You are all set! Then, go back to TaskOn and select "General" in "In Channels" and "Everyone" in "Roles to be mentioned". Confirm.

Go back to Discord and under your server, choose "Server Settings". Then choose "Roles". Here, you can see Stanely, our bot. Make sure that you drag it ahead of other roles.

Now you have successfully added TaskOn Discord bot!

 [GC5]建议将奖励选择gas费低的网络

Question: When those projects who are already Zealy's clients decide to give TaskOn's Go-to-Community service a try, how can we retain them? What are the strong selling points of our product?

Answer: On Zealy, projects need to manually set up, verify, and manage their tasks, which means that the user experience is terrible. In contrast, TaskOn offers an automatic and smart experience.

TaskOn has made great progress with connecting public domain traffic with private domain traffic, which means that projects can cold-start their communities with GTC. Zeal does not do a good job of converting traffic.

With features like points, benefits shop, leadership board, quest, and on-chain tasks, TaskOn's GTC service focuses on helping projects to attract high-quality and loyal users. Zealy is much less result-oriented.

TaskOn provides more flexibility and personalization, which enables projects to build their native communities. Zealy only offers standard community designs.
