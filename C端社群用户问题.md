There are several things I need to confirm with you.

Apart from logging in with your wallet, have you bound any other social
media accounts on Taskon, such as Twitter, Discord, Google, etc.?

If you have bound them, you can fill out the following
form:https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd73g_KQyGHIIzF5ErpPcMymP4_oNhv-\_wYbd-qQ0cBdmmUMQ/viewform?usp=dialog

If not, then I can\'t help you.

After you have completed filling it out, please tell me your wallet
address and Twitter ID.

I\'ll update you if there is any further information.

pending. Even though it has been several days it has not entered my
wallet.
